 ## UX/UI Design
 <hr>

 ### Strategy

#### Site owner goals

- The site was created to encourage people to get to know the Cineplex Planet project.
- The site aims to show a little of the work of innovative cinema.
- The site will talk about the investment in the project, the differences of Cineplex Planet in relation to other common cinemas and which cities will be located.
- The purpose of the site is to attract people to a cinematic experience completely different from anything they have experienced with conventional cinemas.
- The website should be simple to navigate and easy to read.

#### User stories

- As a user, I want to understand the purpose of the website, so I can know if it's of interest to me.
- As a user, I want to easily navigate the site, so I don't lose enthusiasm for using the site.
- As a user, I want to be able to learn something new, so I fulfill the objective that brought me to the site.
- As a user, I want to have access to all the links, so I can connect if it interests me.
- As a user, I want to see media (photos) related to the main subject, so I can better understand what was explained.

### Scope

- For the Cineplex Planet website I have planned the following features.
  - Use images and text for more varied content.
  - Use of short texts and longer texts, so the reading doesn't get too tiring.
  - Use technologies and tools that improve site development and performance.


### Structure

- For the Cineplex Planet site I planned to separate the site into four pages.
  - The initial page (Home), which will be the site's presentation page, will contain a little about the Cineplex Planet project, investment values and how to become a member.
  - The second page (Movies) will show some movies showing on the opening day.
  - The third page (Experience), talks about the types of rooms present in the project and the particularity of each one.
  - The fourth page shows my portfolio so my clients can see about my job so far.
  - The fourth page (Contact), is where the customer can become a member of the cinema, get in touch with us and have access to the head office address.


### Surface

#### Colour scheme

- The colors chosen for the composition of the site were a combination of 6 colors (Night, White, Robin egg blue, Night, Seasalt, Jet).
- To highlight the background color of the text on the pages I used a mixture of dark tones (Night, Jet) with light colors (White, Robin egg blue and Seasalt).
- Here is an image of the color palette used on the website (source: Coolors.io).

#### Typography

  - The font chosen was Kumbh sans

#### Images

- The images selected for the site are intended to complement and help the content. Each selected image was designed to match the section it was added to.
  - About section image: to create an initial visual impact.
  - All images on the page were taken from google.


## Features
<hr>

### Existing Features

- Banner 
  - Present on all pages (Home/Movies/Experience/Contact) is intended to create a style and identity for the page. The elements in the image refer to the title and theme of the site.

- Navigation Bar
  - Present on all pages to facilitate navigation between them. The font is the same used throughout the website, I tried to keep the style and colors the same as the website.
  - I added a hover effect on the navigation options to make them stand out more when selecting them.

- Footer
  - Present on all pages as well. At the bottom of the page, the footer has icons for social networks, making it easier for the user to connect with the community and our site. Applied the hover effect to also discriminate what the destination will be. All options open in a new tab.
