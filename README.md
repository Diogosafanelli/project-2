 ### Strategy

#### Site owner goals

- The site was created to encourage people to get to know the Cineplex Planet project.
- The site aims to show a little of the work of innovative cinema.
- The site will talk about the investment in the project, the differences of Cineplex Planet in relation to other common cinemas and which cities will be located.
- The purpose of the site is to attract people to a cinematic experience completely different from anything they have experienced with conventional cinemas.
- The website should be simple to navigate and easy to read.

#### User stories

- As a user, I want to understand the purpose of the website, so I can know if it's of interest to me.
- As a user, I want to easily navigate the site, so I don't lose enthusiasm for using the site.
- As a user, I want to be able to learn something new, so I fulfill the objective that brought me to the site.
- As a user, I want to have access to all the links, so I can connect if it interests me.
- As a user, I want to see media (photos) related to the main subject, so I can better understand what was explained.

### Scope

- For the Cineplex Planet website I have planned the following features.
  - Use images and text for more varied content.
  - Use of short texts and longer texts, so the reading doesn't get too tiring.
  - Use technologies and tools that improve site development and performance.
